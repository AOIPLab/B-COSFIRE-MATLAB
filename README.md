# MATLAB implementation of B-COSFIRE filters
B-COSFIRE filters are non-linear trainable filters for detection of elongated patterns in images.  
The structure of a B-COSFIRE filter is not fixed in the implementation, 
but is rather learned from a prototype pattern in an automatic configuration process.

## Applications
The B-COSFIRE filters can be applied for the delineation of elongated patterns in images.


## Authors
The B-COSFIRE filters were originally proposed by George Azzopardi, Nicola Strisciuglio, Mario Vento and Nicolai Petkov 
in the paper "Trainable COSFIRE filters for delineation of blood vessels with applciation to retinal images",
published in the Journal of Medical Image Analysis (Elsevier), 2015.  

This code is developed by Nicola Strisciuglio and George Azzopardi.
