# MATLAB implementation of B-COSFIRE filters
B-COSFIRE filters are non-linear trainable filters for detection of elongated patterns in images.
The structure of a B-COSFIRE filter is not fixed in the implementation, 
but is rather learned from a prototype pattern in an automatic configuration process.
